The testbench here shows the three examples that are bootstrap switch, comparator, and delay cell, which all use the custom deisgned cells.
To characterize the specification of each target design.
Take a comparator as an example, which is built based on MND3X1 (Modified Nand 3 input gate). The testbench is to simulate power, delay, 
kickback noise, noise and offset of the comparator.
